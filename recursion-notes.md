### What is Recursion?
Is a method in CS where the solution to a problem relies on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (wiki definition).

What exactly does that mean?! It's easiest to explain by showing you what a recursive algorithm looks like. Recursion essentially is made up of two main components:
1. Base case: which is the condition that collapses the recursion.
1. Where the method calls itself.
